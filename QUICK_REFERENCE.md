# Quick Reference: Batch System Fix

## What Was Fixed
The inventory actions (sell, add, remove) were not respecting the batch system. They were directly updating `quantityInStock` instead of working with batches.

## Changes Summary

### Before (❌ Broken)
```typescript
// Directly updated quantityInStock
await prisma.item.update({
  where: { id: itemId },
  data: { quantityInStock: newQuantity }
})
```

### After (✅ Fixed)
```typescript
// Check if item uses batch system
if (item.useBatchSystem) {
  // Work with batches (FIFO logic)
  // - Reduce oldest batches first
  // - Delete empty batches
  // - Create new batches when adding
  await syncItemQuantityFromBatches(itemId)
} else {
  // Legacy: direct update for non-batch items
  await prisma.item.update({
    where: { id: itemId },
    data: { quantityInStock: newQuantity }
  })
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. FIFO (First In First Out)
- Sells/removes from oldest batches first
- Automatically deletes empty batches
- Proper cost accounting

### 2. Batch Creation
- Add operation creates new batches
- Each batch tracks: quantity, cost, date, location

### 3. Auto-Sync
- Item quantity always matches sum of batches
- Called after every batch operation

### 4. Transaction Safety
- All operations are atomic
- No partial updates if something fails

### 5. Backward Compatible
- Legacy items (useBatchSystem = false) still work
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## What Changed in Each Action

### SELL
- ✅ Reduces quantities from oldest batches (FIFO)
- ✅ Deletes empty batches
- ✅ Creates sale expense record
- ✅ Syncs item quantity

### ADD
- ✅ Creates new batch with added quantity
- ✅ Sets status to 'Arrived'
- ✅ Syncs item quantity

### REMOVE
- ✅ Reduces quantities from oldest batches (FIFO)
- ✅ Deletes empty batches
- ✅ Allocates cost to profit
- ✅ Creates expense record
- ✅ Syncs item quantity

## Files Modified
- `src/app/api/inventory/actions/route.ts` - Main fix

## Deployment Status
✅ Committed: `85a4044`  
✅ Pushed to GitHub  
✅ Deployed to Vercel Production  
✅ Build: Successful  

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test selling items - quantity should decrease
- [ ] Test adding items - quantity should increase
- [ ] Test removing items - quantity should decrease
- [ ] Verify FIFO: oldest batches reduced first
- [ ] Run validation: `npm run validate:batches`
- [ ] Check no errors in Vercel logs

## Validation Command
```bash
# Check consistency
npm run validate:batches

# Auto-fix any issues
npm run validate:batches:fix
```

## Expected Behavior

### Example: Item with 3 batches
```
Batch 1 (oldest): 50 units, created 3 days ago
Batch 2 (middle): 75 units, created 2 days ago
Batch 3 (newest): 25 units, created 1 day ago
Total: 150 units
```

**Sell 100 units:**
- Batch 1: Deleted (50 units sold)
- Batch 2: 25 units remaining (50 units sold)
- Batch 3: 25 units remaining (untouched)
- Item quantity: 50

## Quick Test
1. Go to Inventory → Items
2. Click "Sell" on any item
3. Enter quantity and price
4. Click "Confirm"
5. ✅ Quantity should update immediately
