# Dashboard Filter Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The dashboard filters were not working correctly because they didn't account for the **batch system** architecture where:
- Items belong to companies (at item level)
- Users and locations are assigned at the **batch level** (not item level)
- Filtering by user/location was incorrectly applied at the item level, missing all batch-assigned data

## Changes Made

### 1. API Updates (`src/app/api/dashboard-metrics/route.ts`)

**Key Changes:**
- Added `locationId` parameter support for location-based filtering
- Implemented batch-level filtering with `batchWhere` clause
- Filter batches by `assignedUserId` and `locationId` for batch-system items
- Created `filteredItems` array that properly handles both systems:
  - **Batch system**: Keeps items with matching batches (filtered at batch level)
  - **Legacy system**: Applies user/location filters at item level
- Updated all calculations to use `filteredItems` instead of `items`
- Fixed user metrics to use batch-assigned users for accurate reporting

**Before:**
```typescript
// Old approach - filtered only at item level
if (userId && userId !== 'all') {
  where.assignedUserId = userId  // Only works for legacy items!
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// New approach - filters at batch level for batch-system items
const batchWhere: any = {}
if (userId && userId !== 'all') {
  batchWhere.assignedUserId = userId  // Filters batches correctly
}
if (locationId && locationId !== 'all') {
  batchWhere.locationId = locationId
}

// Apply batch filters in the query
batches: {
  where: Object.keys(batchWhere).length > 0 ? batchWhere : undefined,
  // ... include batch-assigned user and location data
}
```

### 2. Dashboard UI Updates (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

**Added:**
- Location filter dropdown (3rd filter alongside Company and User)
- Fetching of locations from `/api/locations`
- Location state management with `selectedLocation`
- Pass `locationId` parameter to dashboard-metrics API

**Filter Layout:**
```
[Company Filter] [User Filter] [Location Filter]
     (All Companies)  (All Users)    (All Locations)
```

### 3. User Metrics Fix

**Problem:** User metrics only showed legacy item assignments
**Solution:** Properly aggregate batch-assigned users for batch-system items

```typescript
// For batch system items, group by batch's assigned user
item.batches.forEach((batch: any) => {
  if (batch.assignedUser) {
    // Track items per batch-assigned user
    userGroups[batch.assignedUser.id].items.set(item.id, item)
  }
})
```

## Database Schema Understanding

```
Company (owns) → Item (has many) → StockBatch
                                        ↓
                                   assignedUserId (User)
                                   locationId (Location)
```

**Key Insight:** For batch-system items, users and locations are at the batch level, NOT the item level!

## Filter Behavior

| Filter | Applies To | How It Works |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Company | Item level | Items belong to companies |
| User | Batch level (batch items) / Item level (legacy) | Filters batches by assignedUserId |
| Location | Batch level (batch items) / Item level (legacy) | Filters batches by locationId |

## Testing & Deployment

✅ **Build Status:** Successful (no compilation errors)
✅ **Git Commit:** `bcf8de6` - "Fix dashboard filters to work correctly with batch system"
✅ **Deployed to:** Vercel Production
✅ **Deployment URL:** https://manis-core-dashboard-7nlmjmhv3-leoranoes-projects.vercel.app

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Filtering:** Filters now work correctly for both batch-system and legacy items
2. **Complete Feature:** Added missing location filter
3. **Proper User Metrics:** User performance metrics now show batch-assigned inventory
4. **Better UX:** Users can now filter by company, user, AND location simultaneously
5. **Database-Aligned:** Filtering logic matches the actual database schema

## Files Modified

- `src/app/api/dashboard-metrics/route.ts` - Core filtering logic
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added location filter UI
- `FILTERING_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` - Documentation (already existed)

## Recommendations

1. Consider migrating all legacy items to the batch system for consistency
2. Add filter indicators/badges to show active filters
3. Add "Clear All Filters" button for better UX
4. Consider adding date range filters for temporal analysis
