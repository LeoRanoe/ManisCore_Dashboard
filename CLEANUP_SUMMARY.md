### Benefits of Cleanup

✅ **Cleaner repository** - Easier to navigate
✅ **Reduced confusion** - No outdated documentation
✅ **Faster operations** - Less files to scan/index
✅ **Better maintainability** - Only active/useful files remain
✅ **Clear purpose** - Each remaining file has ongoing value

### Next Steps

- Maintain `README.md` as the single source of truth for documentation
- Create new documentation only when needed for ongoing reference
- Remove temporary debug scripts after issues are resolved
- Keep only utility scripts that have ongoing use cases
