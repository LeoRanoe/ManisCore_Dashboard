# Multiple Images Feature for Inventory System

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive multiple images support for inventory items and stock batches. Users can now upload, view, and manage up to 5 product images per item/batch with an elegant gallery interface.

## Implementation Date
January 16, 2025

## What Changed

### 1. Database Schema Update
**File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`

Changed from single image to multiple images array:
```prisma
// Before
imageUrl String?

// After
imageUrls String[] @default([])
```

Applied to both `Item` and `StockBatch` models.

### 2. New Multi-Image Upload Component
**File**: `components/ui/multi-image-upload.tsx`

Features:
- ✅ Upload up to 5 images per product
- ✅ Drag & drop or click to upload
- ✅ Real-time upload progress indicators
- ✅ Image preview in grid layout
- ✅ Individual image deletion
- ✅ File validation (type, size: max 4.5MB)
- ✅ Disabled state support
- ✅ Responsive grid layout (2 columns mobile, 3+ desktop)

### 3. Form Dialogs Updated

#### Item Form Dialog
**File**: `components/inventory/item-form-dialog.tsx`
- Integrated `MultiImageUpload` component
- State management for `imageUrls` array
- Proper serialization in form submission

#### Batch Form Dialog
**File**: `components/inventory/batch-form-dialog.tsx`
- Integrated `MultiImageUpload` component
- State management for `imageUrls` array
- Proper serialization in form submission

### 4. Data Tables Enhanced with Gallery View

#### Item Data Table
**File**: `components/inventory/item-data-table.tsx`

Gallery Features:
- Shows first image as thumbnail
- "+N" badge shows additional image count
- Hover reveals all images in floating preview panel
- Graceful fallback with placeholder icon

#### Batch Data Table
**File**: `components/inventory/batch-data-table.tsx`

Same gallery features as Item Data Table for consistency.

## User Experience

### Uploading Images
1. Open item/batch creation or edit form
2. Click "Browse files" or drag & drop images
3. Upload progress shows for each image
4. Images appear in grid once uploaded
5. Delete individual images with X button
6. Maximum 5 images enforced

### Viewing Images
**In Data Tables**:
- Single image: Shows thumbnail only
- Multiple images: Shows thumbnail with "+2" badge (for example)
- **Hover interaction**: Floating panel appears with all images in 2-column grid
- Clean, professional presentation

**In Forms**:
- Grid layout shows all uploaded images
- Easy management with delete buttons
- Visual feedback during upload

## Technical Details

### Image Storage
- **Service**: Vercel Blob Storage
- **CDN**: Automatic CDN delivery for fast loading
- **Format**: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF supported
- **Size Limit**: 4.5MB per image
- **Naming**: Timestamped unique filenames

### API Endpoints
- **POST** `/api/upload`: Upload single image, returns URL
- **DELETE** `/api/upload`: Delete image by URL from blob storage

### Database
- **Field Type**: `String[]` (array of URLs)
- **Default**: Empty array `[]`
- **Null Handling**: Converted to empty array in forms

### Environment Variables
```
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_...
```
Configured in Vercel dashboard (Production, Preview, Development).

## Migration Path

### From Single Image to Multiple Images

**Database**:
```bash
pnpm db:push
```
Automatically migrated existing single `imageUrl` columns to `imageUrls` arrays.

**Existing Data**: 
- Old records with single image will need manual migration if needed
- New records use array structure from the start

## UI/UX Highlights

### Gallery Hover Preview
- **Trigger**: Mouse hover over thumbnail
- **Display**: Floating panel with shadow
- **Position**: Right side of thumbnail (left-full ml-2)
- **Grid**: 2 columns for compact display
- **Size**: Each image 80x80px in preview
- **Z-index**: 50 to appear above table content

### Upload Component
- **Visual**: Clean grid with rounded corners
- **Feedback**: Progress bars during upload
- **Validation**: Instant error messages for invalid files
- **Accessibility**: Clear labels and disabled states

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Images loaded only when visible
- **CDN Caching**: Vercel Blob provides automatic CDN
- **Optimized Thumbnails**: Small size (48x48px) for table cells
- **Efficient Rendering**: Grid layout with CSS grid
- **Hover Optimization**: Preview panel uses CSS `group-hover:block`

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (tested)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Mobile browsers

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Image Reordering**: Drag & drop to reorder images
2. **Lightbox View**: Full-screen image viewer
3. **Image Editing**: Crop, rotate, filters
4. **Bulk Upload**: Upload multiple products' images at once
5. **Image Compression**: Automatic compression before upload
6. **Alt Text**: Custom alt text for accessibility
