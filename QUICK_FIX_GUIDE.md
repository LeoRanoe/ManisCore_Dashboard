## How to Use the Fixed Features

### Adding Items with Tags

**Tags Field** - Enter comma-separated values:
```
smartphone, apple, 5g, iphone, flagship
```

Will be converted to:
```json
["smartphone", "apple", "5g", "iphone", "flagship"]
```

### Adding YouTube Review URLs

**YouTube URLs Field** - Enter one URL per line:
```
https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123
https://youtube.com/watch?v=def456
https://youtube.com/watch?v=ghi789
```

Will be converted to an array of URLs.

### Adding Companies

- Just enter the company name
- Leave the slug field empty (it will auto-generate)
- Example: "Bijoux Ayu" → slug will be "bijoux-ayu"

## Performance Tips

The dashboard should feel faster now, but here are additional tips:

1. **Close unused tabs** - Reduces memory usage
2. **Clear browser cache** - Removes old cached files
3. **Use search/filters** - Instead of scrolling through all items
4. **Pagination** - Navigate through pages instead of loading all at once

## If You Still Experience Issues

### Laggy Dashboard
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Try clearing cache and hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check if large images are being loaded
4. Verify internet connection speed

### Form Validation Errors
1. Make sure you're using the latest code
2. Check browser console for specific error messages
3. Try refreshing the page

### Company Already Exists
1. Run the fix script: `pnpm exec tsx scripts/fix-empty-slugs.ts`
2. Check all companies have unique slugs
3. Try adding with a different name first
