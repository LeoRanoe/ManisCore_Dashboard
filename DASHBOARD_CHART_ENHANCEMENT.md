# Dashboard Chart Enhancement

## Problem Identified
The original "Items by Status" bar chart was not providing useful insights:
- Only showed item counts by status (ToOrder, Ordered, Arrived, Sold)
- In your case, it only showed "3" items in "Arrived" status
- Other statuses had zero items, making the chart mostly empty
- No actionable information or financial insights
- Taking up valuable dashboard space

## Solution Implemented

Replaced the useless chart with **TWO actionable charts** that provide real business intelligence:

### 1. üìç **Stock Distribution by Location**
**What it shows:**
- Value of inventory at each location (in USD)
- Top 10 locations by stock value
- Horizontal bar chart for easy comparison

**Why it's useful:**
- See where your capital is tied up
- Identify locations with high inventory
- Make decisions about stock redistribution
- Track location-based inventory performance

**Data source:**
- Fetches all batches with "Arrived" status
- Calculates value per location: (costPerUnit + freightPerUnit) √ó quantity
- Sorts by value, shows top 10

### 2. üí∞ **Top Items by Profit Potential**
**What it shows:**
- Items with highest profit margins (percentage)
- Only includes items currently in stock
- Top 10 most profitable items

**Why it's useful:**
- Focus on selling high-margin items first
- Identify which products are most profitable
- Make pricing and purchasing decisions
- Understand which items drive profitability

**Calculations:**
- Profit per unit = Selling Price (SRD) - Total Cost (SRD)
- Total Cost includes: (costPerUnit + freight) √ó USD to SRD rate
- Profit Margin = (Profit / Selling Price) √ó 100%
- Only shows items with positive margins

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Low Stock Alert** (Kept)
This existing feature remains because it's useful:
- Shows items with less than 5 units
- Color-coded urgency (red for 0, orange for <3, yellow for <5)
- Helps prevent stockouts

## Technical Implementation

### New State Variables:
```typescript
const [locationStockData, setLocationStockData] = useState<any[]>([])
const [topProfitItems, setTopProfitItems] = useState<any[]>([])
```

### Data Fetching:
1. **Location Stock:** Fetches batches, filters by "Arrived", groups by location
2. **Profit Items:** Fetches items, calculates profit margins, sorts by margin

### Chart Components:
- Uses Recharts `BarChart` with horizontal layout
- Custom tooltips showing formatted values
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Empty states with helpful messages

## Usage Tips

1. **Location Chart:** Click on bars to see location details (future enhancement)
2. **Profit Chart:** Use this to prioritize which items to promote/sell
